This is a homework for the Java OOP Part II

## IntelliJ IDEA project configuration
1. Clone this project to your local environment

    ```git clone https://github.com/kermek/java-basics-hw04.git``` 
2. Import in IntelliJ IDEA using `File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources...`.
3. Select the directory that you cloned to.
4. Go through the `Import Project` wizard by clicking `Next`.
5. On `Please select project SDK` point it to your Java 1.8 JDK.
6. Press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S` (`Command + ;`) and check that in your `Project Structure`.
Check value of `Project language level` is set to `8 - Lambdas, type annotations et.`.
7. Open test class, put your cursor on `@Test` annotation, press `Alt+Enter`
and choose `Add 'testng' to classpath`.  
8. Set the value to `org.testng:testng:6.14.3` and mark checkbox `Download to`.
9. Complete all TODO tasks. Do not change test class.
10. After you finished assignment compilation should be without any errors (`Ctrl+F9` or `Command + F9`). 


## Employee assignment

Create an interface to the method `calculatePay()`.

The base class `Employee` implements the above interface.
 
Create two classes `SalariedEmployee` and `ContractEmployee`, which are inherited from the base class.

Describe hourly paid workers in the relevant classes (one of the children), and fixed paid workers (second child).

Describe the string variable `socialSecurityNumber` in the class `SalariedEmployee`.

Include a description of `federalTaxId` in the class `ContractEmployee`.

The calculation formula for the "time-worker“ is:

    `the average monthly salary = hourly rate * number of hours worked`

For employees with a fixed payment the formula i
    
    `the average monthly salary = fixed monthly payment`

Test will create an array of employees and add the employees with different form of payment.

Test check the output: employee ID, name, and the average monthly wage for all elements.

## Unit testing
There are number of different ways to run your unit tests, e.g.:
* In test class put your cursor on its definition, right click and choose `Run ...`
* Right click on a little green triangle near the class definition and choose `Run ...`
* In test class put your cursor on its definition and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (`Control+Shift+R`)
* Once you executed your test you could re-run it again by pressing `Shift+F10` (`Control+R`)
